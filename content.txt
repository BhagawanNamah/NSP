Well, this website was never intended to be launched as it was just a learning project for Rishi and Pratik (the backend developers).
After days of Googling, Stackoverflow , Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, this is the best we could come up with.
Unfortunately, we had to write each piece of code ourselves because we couldn't find any source code at Github to copy.
Prachal, the sole FrontEnd Developer of the team sat hours understanding the templates he copied, but at last had to write the major part of the FrontEnd himself.

This was our brief introduction. It's time for you to connect with the developers of Manipal University Jaipur and start working on your own projects. Your profile page will be your introduction to the world, make sure to make it worth watching.
